Using it. I am also an animal lover, game fanatic, and an optimist. I like to keep an open mind with others and I enjoy meeting people and learning more about them.

				<span class="skillCat">Career Synopsis</span>
				<br>
				<p><span class="firstWord">As</span> I said earlier, I am passionate about learning. I have been very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on some really awesome projects, and in varying roles. I have been mentored and taught by many skilled programmers,
					designers, and business people along the way. I am always ready to learn, and always ready to put in the work needed to pick up new skills on the fly.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="firstWord">I</span> aspire to become a very flexible programmer. I am not afraid to expose myself to multiple languages, frameworks, and tech stacks. As of right now, my core competency lies in front end engineering: HTML5, CSS, and
					Javascript. I am currently working on expanding my front end development set and starting on full stack development with NodeJS.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="firstWord">My</span> current project has another developer and myself creating a payment gateway in which people can purchase credits through a Stripe API, and can earn credits while using applications we have designed. This API is very
					robust and complex, but it has done a lot to introduce me to NodeJS.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="firstWord">I</span> have also developed an interactive web based chatter that is modulated and has its own API, allowing it to be used in other products for GOEcorp. This was a more basic, but real experience working with full stack development.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="firstWord">Prior</span> to my development experience, I was unsure as to what exactly I wanted to do. Luckily, I was surrounded by a lot of very experienced talent. I followed their insights and direction, and tried out a few
					roles</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="firstWord">I</span> started off as a business analyst and product owner at first. The team utilized my business insights and vast knowledge on video game revenue and game theory models. As a result, I took on the task of looking at the
					current industry for a big project GOEcorp was starting to design. This lead me to product ownership and then to project manager. This was not my favorite thing to do at all; and ultimately I moved on to UX and UI design.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="firstWord">As</span> a UX designer, I worked with colors, layouts, wireframes, and even some testing. I utilized the Adobe Suite at times and others I used purely open sourced tools like Pencil, or some one offs like Balsamiq. This got
					me a lot closer to code, and understanding the design needs that a project of this size has.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="firstWord">I</span> had an excellent mentor and access to some very experienced talent as I have built this foundation of mine. This mix of experience has really benefited me in that it has given me a lot of insight into all the work
					that goes into creating a stellar web application. It also helped me understand and value the need for separation between business, development, and design as well as the innate need for them to collaborate closely.</p>
